									Once upon a time, there was a girl named Saros who was
									obsessed with spaces and different scientific occurences.With
									her increasing curiosity, she went to her dad who was an
									astrophysicist but from the thought of bothering him during
									his works, she decided to not trouble him and kept her
									questions with herself. She eagerly waited for Friday night as
									that was 'The Chess Day'.She and her dad had a long ritual of
									playing chess every Friday night. She was sure that this
									time,she will at any cost win her dad in chess.She decided to
									use this opportunity to get answers to her curiosities too.

									cycle for eclipses and i was fascinated with that research
									when you were just a little kid." Saros (in excitement) asks
									again,"What's so wonderful about eclipses,Dad?". Dad happily
									says," In order to unveil that you have to first know
